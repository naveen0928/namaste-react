--- Tailwind css - works with react and other UI frameworks as well
                 - uses postcss
                 - gives u classnames automatically for every css you want to write in app
                 - very light weight - keeps bundle size small
                 - only import the css that is absolutly required by the component though it has many classes
                 - Suppose, if we are using m-4 multiple times in component, it will have only one time in browser

--- postcss is used to understand what is written inside the project and it enables tailwind
