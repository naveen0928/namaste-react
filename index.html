<!-- HOME WORK -->

<!-- What is CDN?    GET SOME KNOWLEDGE ON THIS -->
<!-- Content Delivery networks - This is a website where the React library has been hosted and
     we are just puling react from there into our project -->

<!-- 2. What is CrossOrigin -->

<!-- React comes with the philosopy of writing or maipulating the DOM using Javascript -->

<!-- React.createElement("h1", {id: "heading", xyz:"abc"}, "Hello world from Reactt!");
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
    root.render(heading);
Second param from above line is generally used to give attributes like {id: "heading"}
React.createElement actually is a JS object but not h1 tag
root.render take the JS object and then put it on DOM to render -->

<!-- React is only writtten in JSX -->

<!-- Library -- React can work individully in a small portion of app as well 
    Framework - It will have lot of things inside -->
